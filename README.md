# Siggn

A monorepo for a collection of lightweight, type-safe packages for event-driven architecture in TypeScript.

## About

This repository hosts the `Siggn` project, a set of tools designed to facilitate building applications using a pub/sub or message bus pattern. The core idea is to provide simple, composable, and type-safe utilities that can be used in any TypeScript environment.

## Packages

This monorepo contains the following packages:

| Package                          | Description                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`@siggn/core`](./packages/core) | A lightweight and type-safe event-driven pub/sub system. |

_(More packages will be added here as they are developed.)_
